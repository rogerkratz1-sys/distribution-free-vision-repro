Delta versus k plots were produced from per_k_summary_from_downloads.csv generated from g_test_outputs.npz; raw permutation and bootstrap arrays (delta_perms, delta_boots, delta_obs) are archived in the repository. Figures were created with Python (pandas, matplotlib); see CHECKSUMS.txt and requirements.txt for exact provenance.
