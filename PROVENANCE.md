**Repository provenance and archival record**

- **Authors and roles:** List contributors, ORCIDs, and roles (Author; Data curator; Maintainer).
- **Data sources:** For each dataset used, give a persistent identifier, access instructions, and preprocessing steps.
- **Software environment:** Give exact environment capture (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`, OS, Python version); include commands used to capture the environment.
- **Provenance notes:** Describe key transformations that change data state (scripts, orders of operations, random seeds) and where to find logs and intermediate artifacts.
- **Contact:** maintainer@example.org
